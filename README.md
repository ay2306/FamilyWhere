## Workflow

1. When anyone realises that their children or loved ones are lost in the crowd, he/ she will upload **a single photo** of the who lost along with contact information of self.
2. The model will store the image int he database with proper encodings.
3. Whenever the any other person will find that child or a person, he will just click a photo in the app and most probable 3 matches of chlid will be shown along with contact numbers.

## USP
1. Easy to use interface with simple 2 step user actions
2. User just needs to upload one image of the child for face recognition instead of few hundreds required by other deep learning based approaches
3. Great accuracy of the model to identify the child or a person correctly
